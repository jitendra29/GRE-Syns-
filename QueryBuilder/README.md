Query Builder
========
About
-------------
This generates and provides the SQL queries required to initialize the application database.

It uses the WordNet 3.1 dictionary and the MIT Java Wordnet Interface (JWI) which is  a Java library for using WordNet.

The popular GRE wordlist (stored in wordlist.txt) is used to get the list of words, while WordNet is used to get the meanings and synsets of these words.

The SQL files: wordindex.sql, lists.sql and gloss.sql are generated.
